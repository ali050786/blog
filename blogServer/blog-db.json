In every Marvel movie filmed before his passing in November 2018, Lee makes an appearance as a random character, leading many fans to believe that he is one of The Watchers.  The Watchers are an alien race whose purpose is to watch over the Marvel multiverses but are strictly prohibited from interfering. Lee has previously denied this theory but in a post-credits scene for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Lee is seen talking to robed extraterrestrials about his adventures. He was even credited as a “Watcher Informant.”\",\"time\":\"Sat Mar 23 2019 11:20:44 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)\"}",

The movies often portray famous landmarks, so clearly they are still on Earth which has led fans to believe the cars themselves overthrew the human race.  Cars creative director Jay Ward confirmed this theory, saying that cars became so smart they didn’t need us anymore. Because they considered us extra weight, they somehow got rid of us but each car took on the personality of the last human who drove it.\",\"time\":\"Sun Mar 24 2019 11:25:01 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)\"}",

In Buck’s opinion, their parents “got washed up on a shore in a jungle island,” leading many fans to believe that Anna and Elsa might have a long-lost brother named Tarzan.  In an interview with MTV, Buck stood by this theory, suggesting the Frozen mother was pregnant when they got shipwrecked: “[They] end up in the jungle. They end up building a tree house and a leopard kills them, so their baby boy is raised by gorillas.
